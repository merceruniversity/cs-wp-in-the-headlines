Reese, III"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Judge Reese, &#x27;96, took an untraditional path to becoming a judge. After completing his undergraduate degree, he worked in real estate until making the decision to go to law school at the age of 32. He had three small children at the time and wanted to provide better for them as a real estate closing attorney. He decided to attend Mercer Law because of its welcoming environment.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was determined to be successful at it,\u201d Judge Reese said. \u201cI built an approach that failure was not an option.\u201d And has not looked back since. He was able to continue being an engaged father to his children while treating law school as a full-time job, something he was gratified to be able to do. He is appreciative of the support of his family and Mercer Law School as he made his way to a law degree.<\/p>\n<p>Trekking down the path to becoming a judge was not a part of his initial plan. When he graduated, becoming a judge was not a defined career goal. He was working for Georgia Governor Nathan Deal when the opportunity presented itself to start the process to become a judge. While he began yet another successful life path he says that being a \u201cnew judge\u201d was really the only thing that was new about him, as he brought a lot of experience and perspectives to the table.<\/p>\n<p>When reflecting on his career, Judge Reese feels rewarded and pleased with his work to provide safer environments for children brought into state care custody versus reducing the number of children in care at the Department of Human Services. At the Department of Community Health, he began to take interest in those in rural areas and their access to basic healthcare. He worked closely with the Office of Rural Health to help build recognition and awareness about the cause. He would love to see a push beyond healthcare into increased legal representation in the rural areas of our state.<\/p>\n<p>Judge Reese noted that he is very excited to have Cathy Cox as the dean of the Law School. \u201cSince my time in Law School, the number of student applications and the job market has changed tremendously,\u201d said Reese. He believes Dean Cox will help prepare Mercer Law students to face the world and be real problem solvers. Not only is it important to navigate law school, but also navigate the real world.<\/p>\n<p>While Judge Reese&#x27;s path is a hard one to replicate, he advises current students and recent graduates to look at things positively even when they don&#x27;t work out the way they wanted them to. \u201cYour attained skills will be applied in ways that may be different than how you initially imagined. You never know what opportunities will present themselves to you, be ready to always present yourself positively,\u201d says Judge Reese. Although he was not able to participate in many extracurricular activities; he was able to develop relationships with his classmates that will last a lifetime.<\/p>\n<p>He recalled a moment during law school when a certain professor, who most students were intimidated by, really supported him as he was called away for a family emergency. As a nontraditional student, he was glad he was not given special treatment for having a family and being at a different place in life, but it was times like those when Mercer provided compassion and really reinforced his choice in a law school like Mercer Law.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<style type='text\/css'>\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 {\n\t\t\t\tmargin: auto;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 .gallery-item {\n\t\t\t\tfloat: left;\n\t\t\t\tmargin-top: 10px;\n\t\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\t\twidth: 33%;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 img {\n\t\t\t\tborder: 2px solid #cfcfcf;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 .gallery-caption {\n\t\t\t\tmargin-left: 0;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\/* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes\/media.php *\/\n\t\t<\/style>\n\t\t<div id='gallery-2' class='gallery galleryid-9370 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail'><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='http:\/\/munews.wpengine.com\/alumni-profile-judge-clyde-reese\/reesehomepage\/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http:\/\/munews.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ReeseHomepage-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http:\/\/munews.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ReeseHomepage-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/munews.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/ReeseHomepage-130x130.jpg 130w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='http:\/\/munews.wpengine.com\/alumni-profile-judge-clyde-reese\/judge-reese-web\/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http:\/\/munews.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Judge-Reese-web-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http:\/\/munews.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Judge-Reese-web-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/munews.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Judge-Reese-web-130x130.jpg 130w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt><\/dl>\n\t\t\t<br style='clear: both' \/>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Judge Reese, &#x27;96, took an untraditional path to becoming a judge.

This is an intensive one-week course aimed to sharpen their legal skills before the fall semester starts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Incoming first-year students are welcomed with an Introduction to Law course. Five experienced professors work with the students over eight class meetings to introduce the tools of legal analysis, such as critical reading, case synthesis, and statutory analysis. The course also showcases the dynamic nature of the law school classroom. Students construct case briefs, explore note-taking strategies and engage in lively discussions throughout the week. Introduction to Law is coordinated by Professor Karen Sneddon, who explains that the course is meant to help prepare each student for success in his or her first semester of law school.<\/p>\n<p>Second-year students complete a simulation-based course called Introduction to Client Counseling. Students watch client counseling demonstrations, take part in a variety of client counseling simulations&nbsp;and build skills through self-reflection and constructive critique. The course culminates in a final exam during which teams of students participate in a simulated counseling session with a local actor portraying the client.<\/p>\n<p>Professor Sarah Gerwig-Moore describes the need for such an experience, stating, &#8220;Clients are at the heart of our work, and&nbsp;I&nbsp;love seeing students confront the barriers to open and productive client counseling and conversation. This skill is central to what almost all lawyers do, and&nbsp;I&#x27;m proud to teach in a law school environment where it is a major focus.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Third-year students complete a course in alternative dispute resolution (ADR), which exposes them to various forms of dispute resolution techniques, including negotiation, mediation and arbitration as students enter the final year of their legal education and begin to transition into practice. The course includes a plenary session that exposes students to faculty members and lawyers with extensive practical experience in negotiation, arbitration or mediation and who illustrate integrating dispute resolution skills into practice. Then during the week, students break out into small sections comprised of topical lectures, class discussions and work assignments, with assigned reading and projects in the evening. After the initial exposure to experts in the field and classroom instruction, students participate in a significant number of role-play and simulation exercises designed to integrate the daily reading materials and skills with practical, first-hand applications. The simulations place students in the roles of mediators, arbitrators, or negotiators, as well as the clients they serve, allowing students to become sensitive to the unique issues involved in each role.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This week, Mercer Law students completed their first course of the year during Intro Week, which takes place the week following Orientation, but before classes start.
